The solution involves meticulous debugging.  First, ensure you have the latest Android SDK and build tools. Verify that the Gradle version is compatible with your Expo SDK version.  Check the Android Studio log and the Expo CLI output for precise error messages.  These may point to missing dependencies or incorrect settings in your `android/gradle.properties` file.  Common fixes involve updating the Gradle version and cleaning the Android project. If necessary, manually sync the project in Android Studio.  Finally, double-check your environment variables, particularly `ANDROID_HOME` and `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`, to ensure they point to the correct directories.  If all else fails, consider creating a fresh Expo project to rule out local configuration conflicts.
