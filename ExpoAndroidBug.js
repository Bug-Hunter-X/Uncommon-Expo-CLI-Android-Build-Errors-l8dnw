This error occurs when using Expo CLI to build an Android app and involves issues with the Android SDK, build tools, or Gradle.  The error message itself might vary, but it usually points to problems during the build process, such as missing dependencies or incorrect configurations.  This is often due to incompatibilities between Expo's required versions and what's installed on your system, or incorrect environment variables.
