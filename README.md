# Uncommon Expo CLI Android Build Errors

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered while building an Android app using Expo CLI. The error is characterized by vague or misleading error messages during the build process, often stemming from issues within the Android SDK, build tools, or Gradle configurations. The root cause is usually an incompatibility between Expo's required versions and the versions installed on your system, or incorrect environment variable settings.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Follow the instructions in `ExpoAndroidBug.js` to set up a minimal Expo project.
2. Attempt to build the Android app using `expo build:android`. Observe the unusual error messages.

## Solution

The solution, provided in `ExpoAndroidBugSolution.js`, involves carefully reviewing the detailed logs produced by the build process.  This includes cross-checking versions of the Android SDK, build tools, and Gradle against Expo's documentation. It also involves systematically checking and correcting environment variables related to Android development. The core of the solution is precise version matching and thorough environment validation.
